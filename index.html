               <p>The Virtual Biology Lab is a graphical user interface of Symbulation, a computational research platform designed for experimenting with the evolution of endosymbiosis. This virtual lab was created in collaboration with Professor Sarah Deel in the Biology Department at Carleton College, and is catered towards introductory biology students.</p>
               <p>Virtual labs have grown in popularity in recent years because of technological advancements, as well as their ability to benefit students at underprivileged institutions without the resources to support a typical lab experience. Virtual labs are also particularly useful for the study of evolutionary biology because they can overcome challenges such as high expense, sophisticated facilities, and the long amount of time that it can take to observe evolution. Virtual labs allow for more rapid experimentation with evolution while still providing a hands-on experience.</p>
               <p>We built our virtual lab on top of Symbulation, which is an agent-based model of endosymbiosis. It supports a generic host and symbiont type and allows for their reproduction, mutation, and adaptations to the environment. The system has produced many peer-reviewed research papers, and is carefully calibrated to empirical biological dynamics.</p>
               <p>In order to produce our virtual lab, we implemented three main goals. The goals are as follows: 1) produce live graphs as experiments are running for a more complete understanding of the system over time, 2) create an interactive tutorial that guides students through the user interface, and 3) improve overall aesthetics of the graphical user interface, with the specific goal of scaffolding information for the students. We achieved these goals by splitting up our tasks, while working to consistently merge our code throughout the project.</p>
